SweptSurface
More efficient representation for surface tessellation, don't use 2d arrays
Surface surface intersection fails every time - Intersect.threePlanes may be to blame
Marching surface-Surface intersection

SurfaceClosestPoint occasionally fails when point is far from surface - need to check for wild derivatives
Curve interpolation with sparse matrices
Curve approximation
verb.eval.Make.interpCurve with tangents is numerically unstable, implementation likely wrong
