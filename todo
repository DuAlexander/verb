Split

    Segment plane intersection is WRONG!
    Infinite loop on coplanar face with no intersection
    Holes are not recognized

SweptSurface
More efficient representation for surface tessellation, don't use 2d arrays
More exact srf-srf intersection
Marching surface-Surface intersection
SurfaceClosestPoint occasionally fails when point is far from surface - need to check for wild derivatives
Curve interpolation with sparse matrices
Curve approximation
verb.eval.Make.interpCurve with tangents is numerically unstable, implementation likely wrong
