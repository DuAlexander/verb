# The Verb 2.0.0 Docs

**verb is a library for manipulating NURBS geometry.** It does some other things well, but that's the main focus.

## Library Structure

The library is split into several parts:

* **verb.core** - Mathematical and geometric utilities that are shared throughout the library.
* **verb.eval** - Fundamental NURBS algorithms for evaluation, intersection, analysis, and more.
* **verb.exe** - Tools for managing multi-core evaluation on different platforms.
* **verb.geom** - Geometric types that make it easy to work with NURBS without knowing much.
