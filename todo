Curve length
Surface area
NurbsSurface split - similar to curve knot insertion but on surfaces
Curve interpolation with sparse matrices
Curve approximation
Tessellation of spheres causes artifacts at start point
Surface-Surface intersection, marching
Surface lofting
Finish sweep (it's incorrect)
Get rid of eval/header.js - ew ew
verb.eval.nurbs.rational_interp_curve with tangents is numerically unstable, implementation likely wrong
